Using @GeneratedValue() without specifying the sequence to use will make Hibernate to use its default sequence name: hibernate_sequence.

We can supply a sequence name as part of the GeneratedValue annotation. eg.

@GeneratedValue(strategy=SEQUENCE, generator="XXX_id_seq")

If we don't have hibernate_sequence in our schema we could create it:
create sequence <schema>.hibernate_sequence
